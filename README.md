# PotionNotes
A Spigot plugin that creates unique tome items that add beacon-like potion effects to players listed under them.
# Usage
Add this plugin, then type the command "/createtomes" (admin only) to receive your world-unique tomes.
Write usernames in the tome for those players to receive the potion effects. Use a new line for each username.
Any player can use the command "/resettome" to reset their held tome so that it is empty. 
## THIS PLUGIN HAS NOT BEEN TESTED (AND IS NOT DESIGNED) FOR MULTIPLE TOMES OF THE SAME TYPE PER WORLD!
# Configuration
On first enable, a directory named "effect_wands" will be added under the plugins directory. Open the json file there to edit properties of the potion effect like duration and amplifier. Tomes and refresh rate of tomes can be modified via the map in App.java.
